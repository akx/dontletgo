Don't Let Go
============

Way back in 2004, when I was in high school, I made this silly
Flash game called Don't Let Go.  It was featured on the [b3ta]
newsletter and became somewhat popular.

Of course, the high score "encryption" algorithm was
reverse engineered in no time and the high score board filled
with impossible scores, but hey, so it goes.

I also followed up with version 2 (which, looking at the source,
doesn't have any gameplay changes, just better "encryption"
for the high score submission -- and of course that got cracked
in due time anyway -- and, well, it was monetized).
 
Anyway, I was asked if I still have the game somewhere, and
well, yes, yes I apparently do.  The .fla files are in here, 
as are the compiled .swfs.

The server-side PHP 4 code to handle the high score stuff,
that, ah, doesn't need to be released.
